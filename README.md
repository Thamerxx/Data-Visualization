## Dataset

> The dataset presents a every day see of person clients trip information in February 2019. The data was put away in a comma-separated values record (csv) and contains 183,412 columns of datapoints.

> During the project, we performed the following data cleaning and wrangling steps:

> 1- Settled columns (variables) that are not within the redress information sorts. E.g, Start/end_time ought to be in datetime, member_gender and user_type ought to be categorical datatypes.
> 2- Created new columns based on exisiting temporal data for further level of analysis (i.e, added start_date/hour/day/month).
> 3- Sifted out extraordinary exceptions in our dataset that were anticipating us from fittingly making visualizations.


## Summary of Findings

> Supporters contribute to a critical lion's share of bicycle trips in February 2019 of around 90.5%, whereas the other 9.5% was made up of clients. Both endorsers and clients ordinarily had a top utilization period on Thursday and plunged in utilization for the ends of the week (Saturday and Sunday). 

> Clients took longer trips as compared to Supporters There's an increment (in spite of the fact that more critical in Clients) on increment in trip term amid the ends of the week The mistake bars donate us an knowledge into the degree of central inclination between both client sorts, whereby clients ordinarily have a much more extensive spread in trip term - which is not at all like the Supporters who had a much more concentrated information spread, demonstrating that clients are more likely to have a trip term near to the median. This may be due to the terms of bike length per trip (e.g, Supporters have free trips for the primary xx minutes, from that point bringing about extra charges after the every day free trip length.)

> It is clear that the two sorts of riders have diverse utilization designs and behaviors. On weekdays, Monday through Friday, endorsers made overwhelming utilize of the framework, in spite of the fact that weekend ridership was higher, particularly within the evening. When utilized for commuting to work, endorsers made a parcel of ventures between 8 and 9 am and 17 to 18 pm on weekdays. Be that as it may, non-subscribers tended to create more outings between 17 and 18 pm, Monday through Friday. In expansion to the different utilization goals, it seem too be related to the neighborhood activity conditions amid these surge hours.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> Around 90% of the bicycle ventures conducted in February 2019 were made by supporters, with clients making up the remaining 5%. Clients and supporters regularly utilized the benefit most intensely on Thursday and less habitually on the ends of the week (Saturday and Sunday).

> Clients traveled more distant than Endorsers did. There's an increment in travel term on ends of the week (yet it is more articulated among clients). The blunder bars uncover the degree to which the two client sorts vary in terms of central propensity, with clients ordinarily having a much more extensive extend in trip term compared to endorsers who had a much more concentrated information spread. This finding proposes that clients are more likely to have a trip term that's close to the middle. This can be since of how long bicycles final for each travel (e.g, Supporters have free trips for the primary xx minutes, from there on bringing about extra charges after the every day free trip length.)
